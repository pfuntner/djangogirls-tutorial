I'm going through the [Djangogirl Tutorial](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/) creating a small web app for posts.  

* Initially, I successfully opened the app from my Windows workstation and, as per the instructions, put the files here on Git in preparation for deployment to [Python Anywhere!](https://www.pythonanywhere.com)
* Since I started, I've continued to follow the tutorial, using my local files as sort of a staging area to get things working.  Like a regular development process, I've been pushing changes to Git when I was happy and pulling them on PythonAnywhere to get the changes deployed there
